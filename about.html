					<p>After graduating, then teaching in primary schools in London and the South East of England for a number of years, I decided to explore the printmaking that I had enjoyed at college and started making simple screen prints with cut paper stencils.</p>

					<p>A few years and a couple of courses later, I am now printing full time (alongside looking after my two children), using photo stencils to make screen prints from my small home studio in Kent.</p>

					<p>I love to explore pattern and repetition - inspired by the lines, shapes and patterns that can be found in the architecture, landscapes and wildlife around me.</p>

					<p>All the artwork for my stencils is created using photography, hand-drawn illustrations and collage, and I hand print each edition with water-based inks on high quality 300gsm paper.</p>

					<p>I am happy to accept commissions. Please see the contact page for details.</p>	
					
					<p class="thanks">thanks for taking a look at my work, and don't forget to tell your friends ;-)</p>
